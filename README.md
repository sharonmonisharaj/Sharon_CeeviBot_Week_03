# CeeviBot: Sharon's Curriculum Vitae SMS ChatBot
----------
The goal was to program an SMS bot using Sinatra, a Ruby framework, that works by retrieving data from a SQLite database. This was an academic project undertaken at Carnegie Mellon University for the course 'Programming Web Prototypes.'
CeeviBot is my personal Curriculum Vitae SMS chatbot, hence named 'C'ee'v'iBot! He runs on the Heroku server, uses Twilio messaging service for SMS based communication and is a Sinatra application coded in Ruby. Anyone with CeeviBot's phone number can interact with him in order to learn about me and my work experience.
